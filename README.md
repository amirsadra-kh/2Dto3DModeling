## Computer Vision: 2D to 3D Modeling

This project constructs a 3D depth map from a 2D image. Using different lighting on an object, helps to create albedo, normal map and finally the depth map. By taking the depth map to 3D modeling softwares, we can construct a 3D model.

## What is used?

OpenCV with C++ code.
XCode as IDE.
